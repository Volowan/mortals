## Description
Hey I'm Theo, a computational chemist and I love to make my life easier with scripts and tools, mostly in the terminal. Here are some of them.

The name comes from a resemblance with "more tools" so if you'd like to have some more tools feel free to clone or fork.

I am still learning bash language, so constructive user/developer feedback is welcome.

## Disclaimer
I'm mostly taking other people's work and connecting them together, so huge shoutout to all the original developers of the great tools for chemists I'm building on.
